    "#### However, we need to set how small does the p-value have to be before we can sufficiently say that the new page drives more conversions than the old page. This means we need to have a threshold. In practice, a commonly used threshold is Type 1 error rate of 0.05. So if our p-value falls below the type 1 error rate, it suggests that we reject the H0 or null hypothesis. That is, we choose the H1 or alternative hypothesis. Consequently if our p-value is above the threshold error rate, then we fail to reject the H0 or null hypothesis. \n",
    "#### Given that no study or experiment is perfect and that random things can aways happen, the setting of threshold of 0.05 means we would only get a 5 False Positive out of 100 experiments. Getting a small p-value when the null is true is also called False Positive or the type 1 error.\n",
    "#### So, our p-value is 0.9100, which is greater than 0.05. This means that we are not confident to reject the null so we stay with the null hypothesis as our decision. That is, we are confident to say that the new page does not drive more conversions than the old page.\n"
